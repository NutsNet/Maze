                    #          THE MAZE        #

1. MAZE BOT
###########

- A hover bot needs to find the quickest way out of a 3D maze
- You can think of the maze as a box made up of unit cubes
- Each cube is either transparent or solid
- You can move in 6 directions: north, south, east, west, up, down
- Each move is considered to take exactly one cube
- You can only move through transparent cubes
- You cannot move through the boundaries of the maze


2. INPUT FORMAT
###############

- The input file begins with the height of the box measured in cubes
- It describes each layer of the box starting from bottom to top
- Each layer must be the same width and height
- Assume that "#" designates a solid cube and "." a transparent one
- Also, "B" marks your beginning cell and "E" marks the end cell
- Note that "B" and "E" may be in any one of the layers
- Also, assume "B" and "E" can be treated as transparent cubes


3. OUTPUT FORMAT
################

- The output format should output "Not Escapable" or "Escapable"
- If "Escapable", display the steps with the directions: N,S,E,W,U,D
- Make sure the bot finds the solution in the shortest path possible 


4. QUESTION
###########

- Add another Bot called "A" in the sample input
- This bot will start at a different location
- Both bots must find the exit in the shortest amount of moves
- Both bots must make it to the exit without colliding

What is your solution ? Explain ... Do not implement !
